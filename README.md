**Zomato Data Analytics Project**

**Project Overview**

The Zomato Data Analytics Project analyzes customer satisfaction, delivery performance, and operational inefficiencies for Zomato, one of Indiaâ€™s leading food delivery platforms.
The goal is to uncover actionable insights that can help Zomato improve customer retention, reduce order cancellations, and enhance delivery efficiency.
The project uses real-world data to analyze trends, identify key metrics, and offer recommendations for operational improvements.

**Project Objective**

Identify the primary causes of customer dissatisfaction, such as delayed deliveries, canceled orders, and poor customer service.
Analyze operational data to pinpoint areas of inefficiency in the delivery process.
Provide actionable insights to help the marketing, operations, and customer support teams improve overall business performance.

**Data Sources**

This analysis uses a dataset containing:

Customer Orders: Order history, including customer ID, order ID, amount spent, payment method, and order status.
Restaurant Performance: Ratings and performance metrics for different restaurants.
Delivery Metrics: Delivery times, order completion statuses, and geographic information.

**Tools and Technologies Used**

Google Looker Studio: Used for creating visualizations and dashboards to explore trends in the data, such as revenue generation, customer ratings, and delivery performance.
Excel: Data cleaning.

**Methodology**

Investigated key metrics such as average delivery time, customer ratings, and order cancellations.
Identified trends in order cancellations, delivery delays, and customer ratings across cities and cuisines.

**Key Metrics:**

Total Completed Orders: Total number of orders successfully completed.
Average Delivery Time: Average delivery time for orders across cities.
Revenue by City: Identified top-performing cities based on total revenue.
Customer Ratings Distribution: Analyzed customer satisfaction levels.
Payment Methods: Breakdown of payment methods used by customers.

**Data Visualization:**

Created several visualizations (Scorecards, Bar Charts, Pie Charts, Time Series) to track key performance metrics.
Utilized geo maps and heat maps to understand regional performance and identify delivery bottlenecks.

**Insights and Recommendations:**

Suggested marketing and operational strategies based on the findings (e.g., improving delivery efficiency in certain cities, offering targeted promotions based on payment methods).
Analyzed the distribution of delivery times and identified areas where operational improvements could reduce delays.

**Key Findings**

High Delivery Times: Some cities consistently had higher delivery times, which could be improved by optimizing the delivery fleet and reducing operational bottlenecks.
Order Cancellations: A high percentage of order cancellations was linked to delayed deliveries and low restaurant ratings.
Customer Ratings: Restaurants with higher average ratings tended to have fewer order cancellations and higher repeat customer rates.
Payment Method Preferences: UPI and Debit Card were the most preferred payment methods, suggesting that Zomato could focus on enhancing the experience for these customers.

**Impact**

Customer Satisfaction: Addressing the pain points of delivery delays and order cancellations could significantly improve customer retention.
Operational Efficiency: By analyzing the factors contributing to delivery delays, Zomato can take steps to improve delivery logistics and reduce inefficiencies.
Revenue Generation: By focusing on the cities that generate the most revenue, Zomato can prioritize marketing efforts in those regions.
